Welcome to **TrackAI**, a  pantry tracking application. TrackAI leverages Artificial Intelligence to simplify the management of pantry items, offering a seamless and intuitive user experience. 

## Overview

TrackAI is a web-based application that helps users keep track of their pantry items efficiently. The application features a modern user interface built using React.js and Next.js, with additional styling enhancements and interactive features. TrackAI integrates with Google Firebase for authentication and Azure Vision API for image recognition, making it a robust tool for managing pantry inventory.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Users can register and log in using either their email or Google account. Authentication is managed through Google Firebase, ensuring secure and reliable user access.

- **Image Recognition**: Upon logging in, users can upload images of pantry items. The Azure Vision API analyzes these images and identifies the items, allowing users to easily add them to their pantry inventory.

- **Manual Item Addition**: Users have the option to manually add items to their pantry if image recognition is not preferred or available.

- **Search Functionality**: The app includes a powerful search feature that allows users to quickly find specific pantry items.

- **Item Management**: Users can add new items to their pantry or remove existing ones as needed, ensuring their inventory is always up-to-date.
